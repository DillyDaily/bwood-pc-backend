        {title: 'Post-Workout Coffee', blog_content: "To those that workout early in the morning BC they have busy lives....or anyone this may apply to.....consuming caffeine directly after a workout may give you an energy boost, but it could also be throwing a wrench into your body‚Äôs hormone system! During a workout or physically demanding activities our body‚Äôs cortisol (stress hormone) levels increase....this isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and natural due to you stressing your body w exercise. Consuming Caffeine while these levels are high makes them jump higher keeping our bodies in a stressful state. This basically freezes the body‚Äôs production, and that‚Äôs not good...here is why..the goal post workout is to reduce catabolic hormones which allows the body to relax and ‚Äúlet go‚Äù of all the negative byproducts keeping us from our #gainz!! If our stress hormones are high our insides will tense up and we will hold all those nasty toxins. Last, having elevated cortisol levels can have this effect on your body......may cause inflammation, insulin resistance, cardiovascular issues, immune suppression, and can eventually lead to adrenal and thyroid dysregulation, and more!?", image: "https://scontent-dft4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/25348507_10107030371810432_7412698995026920237_n.jpg?oh=ed7833d349dd1704ad49875d91760def&oe=5AD05222" },

        {title: 'Foam Roller', blog_content: "foam rolling (self myofascial release) of the calves. Today we will learn the proper way to roll out the calf muscles. Rollingout is something that need not be rushed. I allow my clients at least 10 min of roll out time. Most people grab a roller and just start rolling like crazy, as if they were rolling out pizza doe. To properly roll out your muscles to serve you better during your workout is quite simple, it requires patience. A proper movement screening will tell you which muscles in your calves are over active and under active. A good warm up will have you roll out the over active and activate the under active (we will address this next week). For the sake of this post I will explain how to roll out all the muscles in your calves. Starting from the bottom up (closest to your foot), the soleus. Place the roller so that it is perpendicular to your calf. You want to start the roller just above your Achilles tendon, from here you want to fully extend your knee to create some tension, pull your toes up toward the sky (dorsiflex), stack your legs, and roll up and down about 2-3 inches slowly. If there are any spots that hurt hold that spot for about 30-45 seconds. Next we have the medial gastrocnemius. Now we want to place the roller in the middle of our calf, fully extend the knee, turn your foot in toward your other leg, stack your legs, and dorsiflex your foot. Roll up and down about 2-3 inches stopping and holding any spots that hurt for 30-45 seconds. Last, we have the lateral gastrocnemius. Place the roller in the middle of your calf, fully extend the knee turn your foot way from your other leg, stack your legs, and dorsiflex your foot. Roll up and down about 2-3 inches stopping and holding and spots that hurt for about 30-45 seconds. If you don't have any spots that hurt then just roll slowly for 2-3 inches for 30-45 seconds.", image: "https://scontent-dft4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25182054_10107030371875302_6803304797235971854_o.jpg?oh=9e953ddc33cc5196bec9cdd00757cce3&oe=5AD08F7F" },
